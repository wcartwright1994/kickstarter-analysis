Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

**Overview of the Project**
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the outcomes of fundraising goals for different Kickstarter campaigns based on their launch dates and fundraising goals. Based on information provided, the focus will be on cmapaigns dealing with the theater, more specifically plays.

**Analysis and Challenges**

Analysis Description
  1. Based on the available data, it appears that campaigns launched during the summer have a higher success rate than campaigns launched during other times of the year. In addition, more campaigns appear to be launched during this time. The lowest success percentage is in December with 49% and the highest success percentage is in may with 67%. The average success percentage across all months is 61% with a standard deviation of 4.4%.

Challenges or Difficulties


**Results**
Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
  1. The largest amount of campaigns, as well as the largest percentage of successful campaigns, were created in May.
  2. Compared to succesful or failed campaigns, very little theater campaigns were cancelled.

Outcomes based on Goals
  1. "Theater: plays" campaigns with a goal under $19,999 has a success rate of over 50% based on the available data.

Summary of Limitations on Dataset
  1. **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date** - Louise's analysis should be performed on the percentage of successful projects compared to only number of projects. Although the month with the most successful projects also aligns with the highest percent of success in the current dataset, this could be different in other years. In addition, layering in the additional category of fundraising goals could paint a different picture based on how much campaigns were looking to raise during particular months.
  2. **Outcomes Based on Goals** - Across the sample data, most of the data is concentrated on campaigns with a goal of less than $10,000. Without knowing Louise's goal, we are unable to know if our analysis will be relevant. If Louise had a goal that was greater than $25,000, there may not be enough data to perform accurate analysis.
